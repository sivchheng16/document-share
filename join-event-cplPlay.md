# CplPlay Event with StadiumX

On August 05, 2025, I attended an event of the Cambodia Prime League. This event was held between the Cambodian Premier League and StadiumX. StadiumX is a panner app for selling tickets to fans to join football. But this time, they set a new project, CplPlay. CplPlay is a game for fans to play with football. CplPlay has player cards to set the other team's football of a player. It plays like when fans are angry between teams and the team that wins, loses or draws 4/4 or 4/5 will get prizes and rewards such as bicycles, phones, laptops and so on. This event also gave me an experience of the event, what they do when they create the event, what is wrong with the event starting time and other things that I saw but I can't tell much. Finally, we took a group photo with the Cambodia Prime League owner and the StadiumX owner.
