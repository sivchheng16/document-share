# Cambodia Premier League Event with StadiumX

On August 05, 2025, I attended a Cambodia Premier League event. This event was held between the Cambodian Premier League and StadiumX. StadiumX is a panner technology application for selling tickets to fans to attend football matches. But this time they have set a new project, CplPlay. CplPlay is a game for fans to play with football. CplPlay has player cards to set the football of other teams of players. It plays like when fans like football teams between other teams. Choose a team and win 4/4 or 4/5, they will get prizes and rewards such as bikes, phones, laptops, etc. The event also gave me the experience of a football event, what they do when they create an event, what is  with the start time of the event, and other things that I saw but I can't tell. Finally, we took a group photo with the owners of Cambodia Premier League and StadiumX.
