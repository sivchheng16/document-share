# The experience with sangamon

In this month two weeks ago I had my first trip and a first time as a tour assistant and
experienced travel with people from the USA. On this trip I had learned a lot about the
Leader team from Mr.lux Mr.sela and Mrs.mey and I also learned about practicing English
talking with the student sangamon. I will write down our trip in Cambodia. but their trip is
going to vietnam after traveling in cambodia.

## In Phnom Penh City

In Phnom Penh we went to the Royal Place, National Museum, Toul Sleng& Choeung Ek
Museum and took a booth by the river in Phnom Penh City. Me and all some students are
told names, asked to talk and change language together when we walk and take the bus
to each position. We just know and we make friends. The last day in Phnom Penh we went
to Siem Reap by taking the night bus.

## In Siem Reap Province

Siem Reap is a province in Cambodia and everything here is good and perfect and it is like
the city of Cambodia. When we arrived we took the tok tok get to the hotel we will stay in.
In Siem Reap we went to the temples like Angkor Wat, Bayon, Banteay Srei, Angkor Thom,
Phnom Kulen and we went to the Museum and the Landmine . Me and the students in
group one are talking about Angkor Wat when we walk. and review about it and they ask
me “what you been here before”. my answer is “I never. but I just went to the seam reap
last week ". And we talk about something else. After we lived here for four days we went to
the home stay in my home town on an island in Kandal Province. We also take the night
bus to Phnom Penh and then we go to the island.

## In Kandal Province

At the home stay we do and live together on an Island we walk to the pagoda and we help
for the people in the pagoda like breaking stones and help take and move the stone in the
kitchen in the pagoda. We also play the score together and play with students in the first
school near the pagoda. In the evening we go to see and we play in the area and we make
happy together. We went to Kampot Province after we had breakfast.

## In Kampot Province

Me and students just walk to eat lunch together at a small restaurant in Kampot Province.
And then we go to the meeting point then go to Tr Peang Songkea community to get a
house stay in Kampot. In Kampot we had to go to the Bouk kor Mountain and go to the
beach and ocean. We talked and walked with and change language each other. last time I
was at Kampot and they will go to Vietnam. I also greeted them when they went to
Vietnam. Before they go I had contact a new friends and we hugged before leaving.

## In Summary This Trip

I had to learn English, practice speaking, have a new friend and leadership for a tour team
from the USA. I also know the position in Cambodia that I have never been there before.
Though I can’t speak English well, I will practice talking and learn more. It will improve my
English speaking more then now .
